            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of milk</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of water</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>

        <ol>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour and the eggs. 
                Gradually add in the milk and water, stirring to combine. 
                Add the salt and butter; beat until smooth.</li>
            <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. 
                Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each crepe. 
                Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface evenly.</li>
            <li>Cook the crepe for about 2 minutes, until the bottom is light brown. Loosen with a spatula, 
                turn and cook the other side. Serve hot and top with fruit of your choosing</li>
