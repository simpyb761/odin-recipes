    <h1>Kung Pao Chicken</h1>
    <img src="../img/kungpao.jpg">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Spicy chicken with peanuts, similar to what is served in Chinese restaurants. 
        It is easy to make, and you can be as sloppy with the measurements as you want. 
        They reduce to a nice, thick sauce. Substitute cashews for peanuts, or bamboo shoots for the water chestnuts. 
        You can't go wrong! Enjoy!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves-cut into chunks</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white wine</li>

        <li>2 tablespoons sesame oil, divided</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch, dissolved in 2 tablespoons water
        </li>
        <li>1 ounce hot chile paste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon distilled white vinegar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons brown sugar</li>
        <li>4 green onions, chopped</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped garlic</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) can water chestnuts</li>
